            <h3>Coach</h3>
            <p>You can also travel by coach around Denmark. Several different companies are operating, but not all of them have English-languages websites, so it’s a good idea to contact the tourist office of the destination you have in mind, to ask for their guidance on routes and tickets. There is one big international operator, Flixbus, which has good and cheap connections across Denmark.</p>

            <h3>Biking</h3>
            <p>Denmark is very easy to explore on a bike with over 10,000 km of biking routes. Many of the cities in the country have bicycle rentals for interested visitors and locals. Many Danes use their bicycle to and from work, and in Copenhagen, it is more than 40 per cent. The bike lanes are extensive and impressive - therefore Denmark is one of the countries in the world where you can see most bicycles. </p>
