            <h4>Butter cookies</h4>
            <p>You’re probably familiar with that blue tin that contains two layers of delicious Danish butter cookies. And while these cookies are 
                    available in other countries, they’re best sampled in their country of origin. Over the past 50 years, they have become part of Danish 
                    culture and are one of the best-loved Danish treats. Plus, in Denmark you’ll find the cookies for sale in a wider variety of blue tins, 
                    often decorated with paintings of famous Danish scenes, so once you’re done with the tasty delicacies, you can use the tin as a decorative item.</p>

            <h4>The Little Mermaid</h4>
            <p>At Copenhagen Souvenir Shop you can find a nice bronze-colored plastic figurine, costing $22, or a porcelain one at $46. The original statue 
                    was donated to the City by brewer Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg beer. The author, sculptor Edvard Eriksen, was inspired by 
                    The Little Mermaid fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, and used his wife, ballerina Eline Eriksen, as a model.</p>

                <h4>Georg Jensen Jewelry</h4>
                <p>One of the most famous and popular Danish jewelry designs is the Georg Jensen Daisy collection. From the flower’s origins, as a national icon 
                    during World War 2, the first Daisy was created to commemorate the birth of the present Danish Queen Margrethe II, who was born 16 April 1940. 
                    Ever since then it has been associated with the Danish royal family and the Queen herself, of course. Nowadays, the Daisy collection comes in 
                    various shapes, colors and styles, and most girls and women in Denmark own a little piece of this beautiful and elegant jewelry collection. The 
                    collection comes in various and affordable prices, ranging from $180 to $1,620. </p>

                <h4>Sømods Bolcher Bonbons</h4>
                <p>The Danes have a peculiar love of salty liquorice, the flavor you will find in abundance at Sømods Bolchers’ small bonbon shop. Bolcher is "bonbons" 
                    in English. Try for instance Dameskrå and Hostebolcher. You can choose from a total of 74 kinds of bonbons there available. A special royal sort and 
                    old classic is the red, sweet and fruity Kongen af Danmark (King of Denmark). Another classic bestseller is the rhubarb-flavored Rabarber. If you 
                    cannot decide on a flavor, just get a mixed bag. If you have diabetes or, for any other reason, do not want sugar, Sømods Bolcher also has an entire 
                    collection of sugar-free bonbons. Prices start at $6 for 100 kilos.</p>

                <h4>LEGO Toys</h4>
                <p>Who hasn't, at some point, played with LEGO toy building bricks as a child? The popular Danish plastic construction game was introduced in 1947 by its
                     founder Ole Kirk Christiansen. The name LEGO comes from the Danish words leg godt, which means "play well". The original toy building bricks were just 
                     the start. Later, in 1969, came Duplo building bricks, a series of simple blocks twice as big as the original and aimed at young children. LEGO also 
                     produces plastic figures, merchandise and themed sets often with a macho theme, like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Toy Story, Batman, Cars, Pirates of the 
                     Caribbean, Avatar, Spider Man and so on. The brand has a massive following and subculture of movies, games, magazines, clothing line and, of course, 
                     theme parks. The original LEGOLAND is located in the town of Billund in Denmark. LEGO toys come in many variations from only $5 apiece. In Copenhagen, 
                     you can enter the world of LEGO in their brand new flagship store.</p>

                <p class="card__text">The Latin Quarter is a charming area in Copenhagen, which goes by the less charming nickname “Pisserenden”. The Piss Trench (Pisserenden) is the popular name for the old part of Nørre Kvarter in the Inner City. In this colourful quarter, you can find a large number of niche shops, where you can buy socks with patterns and clothes in bright colours, which you didn’t even know you needed. You will also find lots of second hand and vintage shops, which offer an entirely different shopping experience than your normal DanChurchSocial (Kirkens Korshær) store.
                    If you are a bit of a nerd when it comes to music, comics or role playing, you can find small shops in the Latin Quarter with original comics, records and role playing equipment.
