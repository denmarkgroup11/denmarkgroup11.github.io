            <p>In Denmark, a European country located north of Germany and belonging to Scandinavia, 
                there is a temperate climate, cold in winter and mild or pleasantly warm in summer. 
                Although it is located at high latitudes, it is affected by ocean currents, so it is not 
                as cold as one might think. In fact, clouds, humidity, rain and wind are predominant. 
                The country is small and flat, so there are little climatic differences between the areas, however, 
                the western coasts of the Jutland peninsula are milder, windier and rainier than the rest of the country.
