                    <p>The museum has existed on the site since 1878, but the castle itself was constructed during the early part of the 17th century. At that time, it was the home of King Christian IV, one of Denmark’s most well-known monarchs. Visitors can roam the halls of the castle and view the vast collection of artwork. The gardens are not to be missed. Particularly of note are the gardens that lie on the far side of a lake, which can be crossed by boat. Some of the best castle views can be had from this vantage point.</p>

                        <p>The Viking Ship Museum at Roskilde has many highlights that fans of history find fascinating. The destination is made even more special through the inclusion of many interactive exhibits, several of which are geared toward children. Most visitors enjoy several original Viking ships that were discovered in Roskilde Fjord, though some are equally enthralled by the working boat yard where Viking shipbuilding techniques are still utilized.</p>

                    <p>Tivoli Gardens was established in 1843. Pleasure gardens were all the rage at the time, and Copenhagen’s version was particularly lovely. In addition to providing a place to view gorgeous blooms, the gardens also became an important social center and a creative outlet for many performing troupes. People visit today for many of the same reasons, as well as for the numerous amusement rides, games, shops and restaurants. The site also hosts many seasonal festivals that typically draw enormous crowds.</p>

                    <p>This attraction is especially for the kids. Nonetheless, most adults find something to enjoy at this amusement park too. The miniland display is particularly interesting with its miniature display of many world famous buildings and places, build up of more than 50 million LEGO bricks. LEGOREDO Town appeals to guests with a wild west sense of adventure while Knights’ Kingdom sets the scene for fairy tale exploration. Certain sections of Legoland are devoted strictly to the little ones. Particularly enthusiastic visitors may want to make a reservation at the onsite hotel or holiday village.</p>

                    <p>Tourists visiting for the first time are often surprised by the relatively small size of the statue. The Little Mermaid statue is only 1.25 meters high and weighs around 175 kg. Designed by Edvard Eriksen, the statue was erected in 1913 to commemorate a play of the Little mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen. The poor lady has lost her head several times but has each time been restored. Copenhagen officials announced that the statue may be moved further out in the harbor, as to avoid further vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it.</p>

                    <p>Most people are more familiar with Kronborg Castle as Elsinore, the name William Shakespeare bestowed upon it in Hamlet. Kronborg has long been considered an important example of a Renaissance castle. Construction began in 1574 on a particularly strategic stretch of land on the Sound, the body of water that forms a border between Denmark and Sweden. For centuries it protected the Danish people and hosted the grand affairs of state dignitaries. Now it is one of the most renowned tourist attractions in Denmark. People may choose from a variety of activities onsite. One of the most popular is a guided tour called In Halmlet’s Footsteps.</p>
