                <img src="img/Tuborg Beer.jpg"/>
                <p>The Carlsberg has owned the Tuborg Brewery since the 1970s. But even so, it retained its distinct flavor with a special place in beverage history. Although it’s not the most popular drink in Denmark, it became one of the best-selling items during the Christmas season. During this time, thousands of customers await its annual release of a special Christmas ale.</p>

                <img src="img/Akvavit.jpg"/>
                <p>Akvavit is one of the most popular local liquors in Denmark and is made from grains and potatoes. For hundreds of years, the Danish people have been distilling the alcohol and have been used for various cultural ceremonies and practices, including festivals. It has a distinct flavor with hints of spices and herbs, traditionally at least, caraway or dill. </p>

                <img src="img/mead.jpg"/>
                <p>Considered one of the world's oldest alcoholic beverages, Mead has also been foundational in Danish culture. It's derived from two main ingredients, namely fermented honey and water, with inclusions with spices, fruits, and other flavors. These flavors are typically added once the Mead is ready to drink. It’s like a cider with its warm feature and a sweet taste.</p>

                <img src="img/Brennivin.jpg"/>
                <p>It’s made mainly from grains and potatoes, giving it features and qualities of a vodka. But what makes it different is that the Danish people have been brewing it even before the term Vodka came to formalization. Brennivin is famous for heavy drinkers or those who want to dose off with the spirits.</p>
